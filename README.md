# Professional Portfolio Application

## Description

This app showcases my professional projects in Web Development. This single-page application utilizes the React library and is responsive to mobile screens. There are several tabs including a brief bio, a resume, and a portfolio with screenshots, as well as working links to deployed projects and their associated GitHub repositories. For those who wish to reach out for further inquiries, a contact form is available. The application is made to be visually appealing and interactive, with accessibility in mind.

While developing this app, I learned about using React which can promote creativity and ease during the development process.
